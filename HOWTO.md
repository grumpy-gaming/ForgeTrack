🚀 Quick Start Guide: How to Run ForgeTrack

The ForgeTrack application is hosted on GitHub as an Angular component source file (inventory.ts). To launch the app, you need to load this source file into a compatible environment that can compile modern web code.

Prerequisites

You need a web code environment that supports Angular/TypeScript (e.g., an online code sandbox, a local IDE like VS Code, or a platform like Canvas).

Step 1: Get the Code (Copy)

Navigate to the ForgeTrack GitHub repository.

Locate the main application source file: inventory.ts.

Copy the entire contents of the file to your clipboard.

Step 2: Launch the Application (Paste & Run)

The quickest way to run the application is to use a simple online code execution tool (e.g., CodePen, JSFiddle, or your development environment's built-in preview).

Open a new code editor window in your environment.

Create a new file and name it inventory.ts.

Paste the content you copied from GitHub into this new inventory.ts file.

Find and click the "Preview" or "Run" button in your environment to compile and load the application.

The application will immediately load the ForgeTrack dashboard in a separate window or panel.

Step 3: Secure Sign-In (Mandatory)

When you first load ForgeTrack, you will be prompted to sign in:

Why: We require sign-in to securely link your inventory data to your permanent account, ensuring persistence and enabling future paid features.

Action: Click the "Sign In with Google" button within the security modal.

Result: This links your unique inventory data to your permanent Google account, ensuring secure access and data persistence across all devices.

Step 4: Your First Devices

Since ForgeTrack starts with generic example devices, you can:

Click on any of the "Example" cards to open the detail panel and rename them to your actual devices (Laptop, RPi, Desktop, etc.).

Click the prominent + Add New Device button on the main dashboard to create a fresh, unique entry for a new system.

This guide should provide new users with a clear and concise path to getting the application running.
