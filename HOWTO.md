🚀 Quick Start Guide: How to Run ForgeTrack

The ForgeTrack application is hosted on GitHub as an Angular component source file (inventory.ts), not a ready-to-run executable. This brief guide explains the easiest way to launch the application.

Prerequisites

You need an environment capable of compiling and serving modern web components (TypeScript/Angular). If you are using an integrated development environment (IDE) or a platform like Canvas, this step is handled automatically.

Step 1: Get the Code

Navigate to the ForgeTrack GitHub repository.

Locate the main source file: inventory.ts.

Copy the entire contents of this file to your clipboard.

Step 2: Launch the Application

The simplest way to run the application is to treat your local development environment (or a platform like Canvas) as the dedicated client:

Open the code editor or file panel in your environment.

Create a new file and name it inventory.ts.

Paste the entire content you copied from GitHub into this new inventory.ts file.

Find and click the "Preview" or "Run" button, which your environment uses to compile the code.

The application will immediately load the ForgeTrack dashboard in a separate window or panel.

Step 3: Secure Sign-In (Mandatory)

When you first load ForgeTrack, you will be prompted to sign in:

Action: Click the "Sign In with Google" button within the security modal.

Result: This links your unique inventory data to your permanent Google account, ensuring secure access and data persistence across all devices.

Step 4: Adding New Devices

Since ForgeTrack starts with generic example devices, you can:

Click on any of the "Example" cards to open the detail panel and rename them to your actual devices (Laptop, RPi, Desktop, etc.).

Click the prominent + Add New Device button on the main dashboard to create a fresh, unique entry for a new system.

This guide should provide new users with a clear and concise path to getting the application running!
